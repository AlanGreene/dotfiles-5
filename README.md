## Choose your path
I've actually designed this repo to have two paths: the Red Pill and Blue Pill, if you will. Choose the Red Pill, or this branch that I've called [mnml](https://github.com/kevinSuttle/dotfiles/tree/mnml), and you take the nomadic, default-loving route. 

Choose the Blue Pill, the [full](https://github.com/kevinSuttle/dotfiles/tree/full) branch until I come up with a more interesting name, and you get a full custom setup with Zsh, Vim, and Ruby.
