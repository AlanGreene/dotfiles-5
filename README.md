I present my humble list of dotfiles. If you haven't experienced the freedom that comes from versioning your dotfiles, check out Github's dedicated [dotfile page](http://dotfiles.github.com).

##About
This is my personal setup that I use everyday. It's centered on Zsh, Vim, and Ruby.


###Setup
1. Open up your terminal of choice.
2. Run ```source install.zsh```
	- If you have existing files, they will **not** be overwritten.
3. Enjoy.

###Teardown
1. Open up your terminal of choice.
2. Run ```source uninstall.zsh```
	- Existing files **will** be removed.
